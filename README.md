#A TIIDELab Team Project by: Team Techathon.

#Description

Job@ease is a career marketplace that matches talent with innovative companies. 
It is an employment website for job listings and for job finding. 
At Job@ease, we strive to put job seekers first, giving them free access to search for jobs, post resumes, and research companies. Our aim is to connect millions of people to new opportunities.
Focusing on the high demand for jobs, we aim to intelligently match outstanding people to full-time and freelance opportunities at the world's most innovative companies.
The goal of Job@ease careers is to consolidate the job application process into one place. When you use Job@ease, you create a profile that outlines your skills, passions, aspirations, and experience.
This becomes the main document that you’ll use to connect with companies. There’s no need to write a one-page resume or a cover letter, which both have restrictive formats that can hinder your ability to pitch yourself.
Once you have joined the Job@ease.com marketplace, your profile will be made visible to all employers who have posted job vacancies on the site.

High regards to all Team one members (Team Techathon) for the solution to this project as we were able to put time into understanding the problems faced by many Nigerians in trying to get a job and employers trying to get the right candidate.
